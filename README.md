# Python-Challenge

In this challenge I am using Python to create a script and analyze the financial records of a company. Thankfully, this company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.

## PyBank
Create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
  
  * In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results
  
  ## PyPoll
  * In this challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process. Analyze the votes and calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

  * In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
